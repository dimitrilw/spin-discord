# spin-discord

Multiple demo Discord bots, written in various languages,
using Fermyon's Spin WASM tooling and hosting.

Each demo-bot is a self-contained directory, with its own README.md.

Note that the frameworks chosen for each language may not be the most popular
Discord framework. I am choosing frameworks that are easy to get started with,
have good documentation, and are fully compatible with this repository's
objectives: slash-commands built as WASM modules, and hosted on Fermyon's Spin.

## languages

- C
